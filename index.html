    <h1>Resume | Jenny Korkeamäki</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I have studied <b>Business Information Technology</b> at Häme University of Applied Sciences. At the moment I am
        looking for an internship either in software/web development or testing, but I wouldn't say no to an opening in 
        IT Support, either. I certainly have customer service experience for that, too.

        This page is currently being build. I have a pretty clear plan I have sketched out on Figma, and I'm pretty sure I am able
        to execute it. There's also going to be a button to toggle between two styles, just to have some functionality instead of just
        a static page, either implemented with React or plain JavaScript. We'll see which one suits my needs as I advance on a Udemy
        Web Development Course.
